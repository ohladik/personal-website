On the backend, I used the GraphQL ORM-like layer Prisma on top of a MySQL database.\n\nThe app allows users to buy a one-way ticket to a Planet in the Solar System in a situation when the environment on Earth is not livable anymore (the tickets canâ€™t be used, yet). Customers can check the air quality in their location to help them to make an informed decision.\n\nI wanted to try out some real-time UI updates so in the ordering process when selecting a seat you can see when another user has selected a seat in the same spaceship as you."
